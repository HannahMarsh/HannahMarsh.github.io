### Impact

Mobile VR Lab not only enhances how subjects are taught but also who can learn effectively from them. By removing traditional barriers such as geographical isolation and the lack of advanced facilities in schools, we open up new worlds for students everywhere.

---

### Accessibility

The design consideration around accessibility ensures that students with different learning needs and capabilities can equally benefit from the Mobile VR Lab.

---

### Future Developments

As technology evolves, so will the Mobile VR Lab. Future updates include improved gesture recognition, more detailed environmental interactions, and expanded content libraries to cover additional subjects.
