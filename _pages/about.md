Hello! I'm a PhD student at [Tufts University](https://www.tufts.edu/) with a strong foundation in computer science. My academic journey began at the [University of New Hampshire](https://www.unh.edu/), where I earned my [B.S. in Computer Science](https://catalog.unh.edu/undergraduate/engineering-physical-sciences/programs-study/computer-science/computer-science-major-bs/) and gained valuable research experience in exploring fault tolerance for distributed caching systems. My technical expertise includes a wide range of skills in both front-end and back-end development, spanning multiple languages such as [Java](https://www.java.com), [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/), [C](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)>), [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B), [Go](https://go.dev/), [Python](https://www.python.org/), and [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript), among others.

I enjoy navigating the intersection of theory and practical application, with my current research interests including [computational geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_geometry) and [onion routing protocols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onion_routing) such as _[Î <sub>t</sub>](https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/885.pdf)_. I'm always open to discussing potential collaborations and sharing insights on my latest projects. [Connect with me on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hannah-marsh-636678291) to follow my journey, or [follow me on Medium](https://medium.com/@hannah.marsh_64502) to see which recent papers I find interesting.

Thank you for visiting my page. I'm excited about what the future holds and look forward to making an impact in the field of computer science!
