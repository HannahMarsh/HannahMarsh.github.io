I am a PhD student at [Tufts University](https://www.tufts.edu/) with a strong foundation in software engineering and cybersecurity. My academic journey began at the [University of New Hampshire](https://www.unh.edu/), where I earned my [B.S. in Computer Science](https://catalog.unh.edu/undergraduate/engineering-physical-sciences/programs-study/computer-science/computer-science-major-bs/) and gained valuable research experience in exploring fault tolerance for distributed caching systems. My technical expertise includes a wide range of skills in both front-end and back-end development, spanning multiple languages such as [Java](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/whatis_java.html), [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/), [C](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)>), [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B), [Go](https://go.dev/), [Python](https://www.python.org/), and [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript), among others.

I enjoy navigating the intersection of theory and practical application, with my current research interests including encryption and quantum computing.
